Q1: Which of the following are the characteristics of a flowchart?

Ans:a: Diagrammatic Representation.
    b: Language Independent.
    c: Easy Documentation.

Q2: Which of the following is true about flowcharts:

Ans:a: Flowcharts can have one starting points and one end points:
    b: Flowcharts must have one starting point and can have multiple end points.

Q3: You are given three numbers. You need to calculate and print their average value. Draw a flowchart for this process.

Note : You don't need to submit the problem. Just attempt in your notebook and ask doubts if you need help.


Q4:Using the flowchart shown below, calculate the Interest for Bank Deposit.

Given : Amount = 1000. Years = 2. Rate = 8.

Ans: As per the flowcharts, the formula for interest =
 
   Amount*Years*Rate/100;
  
     1000*2*8/100
       =  160.

Q5: Find the Correct output based on the flowchart.

Given : X = 4, Y = 8, Z = 5.
Ans: Y>Z>X 
   solution description= The given flowharts prints the descending order the given three numbers. So 8>5>4, and 
   hence Will be the  output .

Q6: You are given a single number. You need to print one of the following outputs according to the number's nature.

Print 1, if the number is positive

Print -1, if it's negative

Print 0, if it's equal to 0

Draw a flowchart for this process.

Note : You don't need to submit the problem. Just attempt in your notebook and ask doubts if you need help.


Q7: You are given 3 numbers. Each number represents the length of a line. You need to figure out whether these lines can form a valid triangle.

If a valid triangle can be formed, print "Yes", otherwise print "No".

Draw a flowchart for this process

A triangle is a valid triangle, If and only If, the sum of any two sides of a triangle is greater than the third side. For Example, let A, B and C are three sides of a triangle. Then, A + B > C, B + C > A and C + A > B

Note : You don't need to submit the problem. Just attempt in your notebook and ask doubts if you need help.


Q8: You are given a single non-negative integer, N. You need to calculate and print N factorial (N!)

N factorial is defined as the product of all integers from 1 to N (both inclusive)

Draw a flowchart for this process

Note : You don't need to submit the problem. Just attempt in your notebook and ask doubts if you need help.


Q9: You are given a single positive integer, N. You need to print all even integers that occur between 1 and N (both inclusive).

Draw a flowchart for this process

Note : You don't need to submit the problem. Just attempt in your notebook and ask doubts if you need help.


Q10: Draw a flowchart to take a number N from user. And check if that number is prime or not.

Print "Yes" if number is prime, otherwise print "No".

Assume N >= 2.

Note : You don't need to submit the problem. Just attempt in your notebook and ask doubts if you need help.





                                                           **************   Week 1(MCQ are Complete.)***************************

Q1: Problem statement
You are given the lengths of 3 sides of a valid triangle. You need to print any one of the following outputs depending on the triangle's nature.

Print 1, if the triangle is equilateral
Print 0, if it's isosceles
Print -1, if it's scalene
Draw a flowchart for this process.



Note: Following are the definitions: -

Equilateral: A triangle with all sides of equal length.
Isosceles: A triangle with two sides of equal length and two angles of equal measure.
Scalene: A triangle with no sides of equal length1

Note : You don't need to submit the problem. Just attempt in your notebook and ask doubts if you need help.
